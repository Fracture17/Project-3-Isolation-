Project 3 for CS 420 Artificial Intelligence

This program uses alpha-beta pruning to compete in the game Isolation.

Isolation is played on a 8x8 chess-style board with 2 players.  The player who goes first starts in the upper left corner, 
and the second player starts on the bottom left.  Each turn, a player can move anywhere in the 8 cardinal and diagonal directions.
Players cannot land on or pass through spaces that are, or have been, occupied.  The player who is unable to make any moves 
on their turn loses.

This program uses iterative deepening to find the best rated move within a given time limit.  The state evaluation heuristic is
the number of moves the program can make minus the number of moves the opponent has times 3.  The heuristic is applied to
nodes below the target depth to sort them, increasing the efficiency of the AB pruning.  After every DFS, the results are used to
sort the next search iteration.

This program is optimized for speed.  The state of the board is represented by a 64 bit integer, which represents which spaces
have been landed on, and 2 8 bit chars which hold the bit index of each player, reducing register pressure and stack operations.
Moves are generated using fast bitwise logic, with no conditional logic or branches involved.  It can easily evaluate more than
15 million nodes per second.
